#ROP: Read Origin Protocol

ROP is a computational protocol aimed to discover the source of all reads, 
which originate from complex RNA molecules, recombinant antibodies and 
microbial communities. The ROP accounts for 98.8% of all reads across poly(A) 
and ribo-depletion protocols, compared to 83.8% by conventional reference-based 
protocols. ROP profiles repeats, circRNAs, gene fusions, trans-splicing events, 
recombined B/T-cell receptor sequences and microbial communities. The 'dumpster 
diving' profile of unmapped reads output by our method is not limited to 
RNA-Seq technology and may be applied to whole-exome and whole-genome 
sequencing.

We switched to SourceForge to store the official releases of ROP: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/rop2/. The code at github is in permanent 
development and should be used for development only. Consider contacting 
smangul@ucla.edu.
